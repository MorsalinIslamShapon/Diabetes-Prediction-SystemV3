## Project Overview

Diabetes is a significant health concern worldwide. Early detection and prediction can lead to better management and treatment. This project employs machine learning techniques to analyze health data and predict the likelihood of diabetes. The application is built using Streamlit, providing an interactive web interface for users to input their health metrics and receive predictions.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes several powerful libraries and frameworks:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For developing and testing machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: A robust model for classification tasks.
- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**:
  - **Pandas**: For data handling and manipulation.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - **Matplotlib**: For basic plotting.
  - **Seaborn**: For advanced visualizations.
  - **Plotly**: For interactive plots.
- **Web Framework**:
  - **Streamlit**: For creating the web application interface.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Input health data easily through a clean and intuitive interface.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Get immediate predictions based on the input data.
- **Model Interpretability**: Understand how the model arrives at predictions using SHAP and permutation importance.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize data trends and model performance with interactive plots.

## Installation

To set up the Diabetes Prediction System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MorsalinIslamShapon/Diabetes-Prediction-SystemV3.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Diabetes-Prediction-SystemV3
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Launch the Streamlit app with:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser. You will see the interface where you can input your health data. Fill in the required fields and click the "Predict" button to receive your diabetes prediction.

## How It Works

The system leverages a Random Forest Classifier trained on a dataset containing various health metrics. When a user inputs their data, the model processes this information and provides a prediction on the likelihood of diabetes. 

The model is trained using a diverse dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability. The training process involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, followed by model evaluation using various metrics.

## Model Interpretability

Understanding how a model makes predictions is crucial for trust and transparency. This project employs two key interpretability tools:

1. **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**: This method explains the output of any machine learning model. It assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction, helping users understand which factors influence their diabetes risk.

2. **Permutation Importance**: This technique measures the impact of each feature on the model's accuracy. By shuffling the values of a feature and observing the change in model performance, users can gauge the importance of that feature.
